__Aprioti Algorithm__
1. Find frequent 1-itemssets first, then 2-itemsets, etc

2. For finding (k+1)-itemsets C_(k+1): consider only those as candidates,
   where all k-itemsets C_k is in C_(k+1) are frequent

3. Count frequenct of all k-itemset candidates in a singe database scan
   (Hashing of the candidate itemset)
