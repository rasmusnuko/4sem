Exercise 2.1
(a) A database contains transactions over the following items: “apples”, “bananas”, and “cherries”.
How many different combinations of these items can exist? 
(i.e., how many different transactions could possibly occur in the database)
      - 7 Transactions (2^n -1 ), -1 because of no empty set:
        {A}, {B}, {C}, {A,B}, {A,C}, {B,C}, {A,B,C}

(b) The database now also contains the items “dates”, “eggplants”, “ﬁgs”, and “guavas”. How many possible
transactions do we have now?
      - 2^7-1 (no empty set) = 127

(c) How many combinations (possible different transactions) do we have with n items?
      - 2^n-1 (no empty set)

(d) How many transactions with exactly two items (i.e., 2-itemsets),
    can we have when the database contains 3 items?
      - 
    When it contains 5 items?
      - 
    How many k-itemsets do we have when the database contains n items?
      -
