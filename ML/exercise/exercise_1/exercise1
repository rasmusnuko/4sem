Exercise 1.1
Which data mining tasks (association rule mining, clustering, outlier detection, classification, etc.) are hiding
in the following use cases? Are the tasks supervised or unsupervised?

(a) Optical character recognition/OCR
        Classification
        Supervised

(b) Computer Aided Diagnosis
	Classification --> (Clutering with meaning to labels)
        Clustering --> (Cluters categories are not known before hand)

(c) Cheat Detection
        Outlier Detection

(d) Recommendation Systems
	Association rules
	

(e) News Aggregation
        Classification of Cluserting
	Outlier detection


(f) Extraction of Data / Web Scraping
        

(g) Identiﬁcation of the most important suppliers
        Outlier Detection
        

Exercise 1.2
S = {a,b,c} ; T = {c,d}
(a) S ∪ T
   {a, b, c, d} 

(b) S ∩ T
    {a, d}

(c) S¯
    {d, e, f, ..., x, y, z}

(d) S \ T
    {a, b}

(e) S × T
    {(a,c), (a,d), (b,c), (b,d), (c,c), (c,d)}

(f) power(S)
    {Ø, a, b, c, (a,b), (a,c), (b,c), (a,b,c)}

(g) S ∩ T¯
    {a, b}



Exercise 1.3

Consider the sets A = {a, b, c} and Z = {1, 2, 3, 4} and some binary relation over them.
If for example the elements a ∈ A and 2 ∈ Z are in relation R could we write: aR2 or (a, 2) ∈ R.

See ./Visuals/Ex1.3*
(a) The Cartesian product A × Z
(b) A binary relation over A and Z, that is not a function.
(c) A non-total function A → Z
(d) A total function A → Z

(e) We called the case c) non-total
    Could we have called it partial, or would that make a difference?
    - Hmmmm





Exercise 1.4

(b) What kind of formats should a dataset have in order to be analyzed with WEKA? What could be done
    with other formats?
        - filetype: .arff 

(c) Check out the “iris” dataset. Read about it (e.g, wikipedia) to understand its properties (e.g., how many
     attributes, meaning of attributes, classes).

(d) Start the WEKA explorer.
(e) Load iris.arff.
(f) Go to the “Cluster”-tab and run “SimpleKMeans”. Make sure to set the parameter for the number of
     clusters to the known number of classes in the dataset. Also use the button “IgnoreAttributes” to ignore
     the class attribute.
(g) Right-click on the result allows you to visualize the cluster assignments. Explore the possibilities. Com-
     pare colors by cluster and colors by class. Are the clusters similar to the classes?

(h) You can visualize different combinations (pairs) of attributes. In some attribute combinations, the clusters
     are better separated. Why?

(i) Try some preprocessing (e.g., use ﬁlter “Normalize”, or select additional attributes to ignore) and repeat
the clustering. What do you observe?
