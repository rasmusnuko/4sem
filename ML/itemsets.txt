__ITEMSETS__
An itemsset X belongs to the border (wrt. sigma)
    - All Y that are in X: Y is frquent
    - All Z that are not in X: Z in not frequent

Maximal Frequent Itemset 
    - Due antimonotonicity, solutions can be summarized by their borders
    - Can be used as a condensed representation of a solution.
      As all itemsets can be derived from the maximal frequent itemsets
    - Positive border
        ' X itself is frequent
          (X is also a maximal frequent itemset)
    - Negative border
        ' X itself is not frequent

Closed Itemsets
    - An itemset X is closed, if none of its immediate superset
      has exactly the same support as X

Closed Frequent Itemset
    - Close itemsets that are frequent (wrt Sigma)
    - Represent a solution (all frequent itemsets) and their support
