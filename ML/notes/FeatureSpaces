Characteristics
    - Nominal (Categories)
      ' No meaningful distance
      ' Sex, eye color, etc
    - Oridinal
      ' No uniform distance
      ' Order relation (eg. better/worse)
    - Metric
      ' Meaningful relation
      ' Age, height, width

Aggregations of Features
    - Absolute frequency: f(n) number of occurences in the sample
    - Relative frequency: p(a) = f(a)/n
    - Mode: The value with the largest frequency
    - Median (for non-nomial features)
      ' The central elemnt in the sample
    - Arithmetic mean (For metric features)
      ' Average

Aggregations of Feature Vectors
    - Controid: Adding all vectors and dividing it by n (vectors)
    - Modoid: The object that has the smallest distance to all the other objects

Feature Space and Distance Function
    - A feature space is a domain with a distance function
    - 'dom' is a sorted set of features
    - 'dist': dom x dom > R_0^+ is a total (distance) function
       with the following properties:
         ' Strictness:
                      For any to object that are not the same,
                      the distance is posititve
         ' Reflexivity:
                      If we take the distance from a object to itself,
                      the distance has to be 0
         ' Symmetry:
                      For any pair of object,
                      the distance is the same both ways

Common distance Functions:
    - Euclidean norm (L2)
    - Manhattan norm (L1)
    - Maximum norm (L_max)
    - Weighted Euclidean Norm
    - Quadratic norm


Distance measures
    - JL
    - Jaccard
    - Cosine
