Problem 1: Find all the frequent itemsets
*** Pseudo code (Arthur's Slides 78) ***

    1. Find frequent 1-itemssets first, then 2-itemsets, etc

    2. For finding (k+1)-itemsets C_(k+1): consider only those as candidates,
       where all k-itemsets C_k is in C_(k+1) are frequent

    3. Count frequenct of all k-itemset candidates in a singe database scan
       (Hashing of the candidate itemset)



Problem 2: Find association rules, given an confidence, 
           via. solution from problem 1.

Association Rules
\ Support of Rule / Support of Antecedent 
    - If a rule is not confident
        * Then it's 'children' are not confident aswell.
    - Splitting a frequent itemset into Antecedent + Consequent
        * BEGH
          - Antecedent eg. BEG,   BG
          - Consequent eg. H,     EH
    - Support of sigma divided by Support(Antecedent -> Consequent)


Theorem 2.1
    If Y is a subset of X (not Ã˜)
    If conf(Y --> X/Y) < confidence
    Any subset of Y = Y':
       conf(Y' --> X/Y') < confidence
