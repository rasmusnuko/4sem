Review Questions

Section 1.1
    1.1 What are the four components of a computer system?
	- Hardware, OS, Applications and the user

    1.2 Provide at least three resources the operating system allocates.
	- CPU, Memory and I/O Devices

    1.3 What is the common name used to refer to the operating systemprogram?
	- Control Program

    1.4 What do mobile operating systems often include in addition to the corekernel?
    	- Middleware, A framework providing additional services for developers


Section 1.2
    1.5 What is an interrupt?
    	- A way for I/O devices to reach the CPU. When an interupt is sent, the CPU's proccess is set on hold.

    1.6 What special operation triggers a software interrupt?
    	- System calls

    1.7 What is one advantage of using a solid state disk over a magnetic disk?
    	- It is way faster

    1.8 What is the difference between volatile and nonvolatile storage?
	- Volatile storage gets wiped when the system is shutdown

Section 1.3
    1.9 What is another term for multiprocessor system?
    	- Multicore SMP System

    1.10 Provide at least two advantages of multiprocessor systems
	- Increased thorughput
	- They stay cooler 

    1.11 True or False? The most common multiple-processor system usesasymmetric multiprocessing
	- False, the most common one in Symmetric Multiprocessing (SMP)

    1.12 What is the name of a multiprocessor system that uses multiple computing cores?
	- Multicpre system

    1.13 How does a clustered system differ from a multicore system?
	- They are composed of multiple systems, whereas a multicore system is a single system

Section 1.4
    1.14 How does multiprogramming increase CPU utilization?
    	- Programs often have to wait. When a wait occurs, another program is executed
	    The programs are stored in memory in the mean time.

    1.15 What is the term for a program that has been loaded and is executing?
    	- A Process

    1.16 What part of the operating system makes the decision with regards to which job will run?
    	- CPU scheduling 


Section 1.5
    1.17 What are the two separate modes of operation?
    	- User
	- Kernel

    1.18 What is the mode of the system at boot time?
    	- Kernel

    1.19 What is the mode of the system when the operating system gains control?
	- Kernel
	
    1.20 What is the mode of the system when a user program is running?
	- User

    1.21 Name at least two activities the operating system is responsible for inconnection with memory management.
	- What parts of memory is being used, and what processes are using them
	- Allocating and Deallocating memory
	- Deciding which processes and data to move in and out of memory

    1.22 True or False? Managing files is one of the most visible aspects of anoperating system.
    	- True

    1.23 Name at least two activities the operating system is responsible for inconnection with file management
	- Creating and deleting file / directories
	- Supporting primitives for manipulating files / directories
	- Mapping files to storage
	- Backing up files on stable storage media

    1.24 Name at least two activities the operating system is responsible for inconnection with disk management.
	- Mounting and Demounting
	- Free-space management
	- Storage allocation
	- Disk sceduling
	- Partitioning
	- Protection

    1.25 Of the following five forms of storage, rank them from fastestto slowestin terms of access time:
    	(1) main memory
	(2) magnetic disk
	(3) registers
	(4) solid state disk
	(5) cache

	- 3,5,1,4,2


Section 1.6
    1.26 What is the difference between protection and security?
	- Protection: Defending proccesses from users
	- Security: securityto defend a system from external and internal attacks (Hacks / Vira)


Section 1.9
    1.29 List at least four common kernel data structures.
	- List
	- Stack
	- Queue
	- Trees
	- Hash functions & Maps
	- Bitstrings

    1.30 True or False? A bitmap of length N can be used to represent the status of 2^N items.
	- False, it can represent the status of N items (eg. 0 = Available, 1 = Busy)


Section 1.10
    1.31 List at least five different types of computing environments.
	- Traditional Computing (PCs)
	- Mobile Computing (Cellphones)
	- Client-Server Computing (Requests)
	- Peer2Peer (Peers are both Cliend and Server)
	- Cloud Computing
	    * Public (Vultr)
	    * Private (Company)
	    * Hybrid
	    * Software as a Service (Google Docs)
	    * Platform as a Service (ElephantSQL)
	    * Infrastructure as a Service (Dropbox)
	    * Real-Time Embedded Systems (Toaster, VolkswagenOS)

Section 1.11
    1.32 Provide an example of an open source operating system.
	- Arch Linux
