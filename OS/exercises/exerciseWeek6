1.1 What are the three main purposes of an operating system?
      ' Managing a computer's hardware

1.3 What is the main difficulty that a programmer must overcome in
    writing an operating system for a real-time environment?
      ' 


1.4 Keeping in mind the various definitions ofoperating system,
    consider whether the operating system should include applications
    such as webbrowsers and mail programs. Argue both that it should and
    that it should not, and support your answers.
      ' Including a lot of desirable programs, can lead to ease of use
        for the end user, but for users who have specific prefered
        software that they won't it can lead using resources without
        any need for it.
      ' Windows 100 apps that you can't uninstall


1.5 How does the distinction between kernel mode and user mode
    function as a rudimentary form of protection (security)?
      ' It makes sure that the user can't execute code
        that can be harmful for the functionality of the computer


1.6 Which of the following instructions should be privileged?
  a.  Set value of timer.
  b.  Read the clock.
  c.  Clear memory.
  d.  Issue a trap instruction.
  e.  Turn off interrupts.
  f.  Modify entries in device-status table.
  g.  Switch from user to kernel mode.
  h.  Access I/O device.

1.8 Some CPUs provide for more than two modes of operation.
    What are two possible uses of these multiple modes?
      ' 


1.10 Give two reasons why caches are useful. What problems do they solve?     What problems do they cause? If a cache can be made as large as
     the device for which it is caching (for instance, a cache as large
     as a disk),why not make it that large and eliminate the device?

1.11 Distinguish between the client–server and peer-to-peer models of '
     distributed systems.

1.12 How do clustered systems differ from multiprocessor systems?
     What isrequired for two machines belonging to a cluster to cooperat
     to provide a highly available service?
      ' 


1.14 What is the purpose of interrupts? How does an interrupt differ fro
     a trap? Can traps be generated intentionally by a user program?
     If so, for what purpose?
      ' 


1.16 Direct memory access is used for high-speed I/O devices in order toavoid increasing theCPU’s execution load.
  a.  How does theCPUinterface with the device to coordinate thetransfer?
  b.  How does theCPUknow when the memory operations are com-plete?
  c.  TheCPUis allowed to execute other programs while the DMA controlle
      is transferring data. Does this process interfere with the 
      execution of the user programs? If so, describe what forms 
      of interference are caused.

1.19 Rank the following storage systems from slowest to fastest:
  a.  Hard-disk drives
  b.  Registers
  c.  Optical disk
  d.  Main memory
  e.  Nonvolatile memory
  f.  Magnetic tapes
  g.  Cache
