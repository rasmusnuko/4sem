Process control
    - End, abort
    - load, execute
    - create process, teminate process
    - Get process attributes, set process attributes
    - Wait for time
    - Wait event, signal event
    - Allocate and free memory


File management
    - Create, delete
    - open, close
    - read, write, reposition


Protection
    - Control access to resources
    - Get and set permissions


Linkers and Loaders
    - Linker combines object files to a single executable
    - Loader starts the executable


Difference between Policy and Mechanism
    - Policy: WHAT will be done?
        ' Policies decide what will be done
    - Mechanism: HOW to do it?
        ' Mechanisms determine how to do something
    - The sepearation of policy and mechanism is a very
      important principle, it allows maximum flexibility
      if policy decisions are to be changed later.


Implementation
    - Main body of a OS is written in C
    - Lowest level implementations are done i ASM


System Structures
    Linux System Structure
         - Monolithic: One address space
    Layered Approach
         - Slow, because you have to go through all the layers
    Microkernel
         - 3 Kernel opeations:
             Basic IPC, Virtual Memory, Scheduling
         - Moves as much from the kernel into user space
         - Example: Mach (Darwin is partly based on Mach)
         - Benefits:
             Easier to extend
             Eaiser to port the OS to new systems
             More reliable (Less code running in Kernel mode)
             More secure (Less places it can go wrong)
         - Detriments:
             Performance overheda of user space to kernel
             space communication
    Kernel Modules
         - Object Oriented approach
         - F.eks. Interfacing for hardware
    Hybrid Systems
         - Most modern OSs are actually not one pure structure


Opeating-System debugging
    - OSes generate log files, containing error information
    - Tracing: Collecting data for specific events
      Terminal instrumentation
        ' STrace, DTrace, BPFTrace, GDB, perf, tcpdump
